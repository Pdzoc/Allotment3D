# ALLOTMENT 3D

## Info
* Language: ENG / PL
* Age: probably 7+ (multiplication in game)
* Genre: FPP, adventure, educational

It's simple "adventure-educational" game strongly inspired by Lego Island. Suitable for primary school children.
The game offers first-person perspective and third-person perspective while driving. During the game, the player will be solving mathematical operations (addition and a little bit of multiplication). You can set the range for addition before starting.

## Plot

The nameless hero is tired of his boring job - a big, loud city, tapping on the keyboard all day in a small, gray office... He needs a break and decides to take a vacation. His destination is a small island where his grandparents have an allotment (although they don't appear in the game). Someone challenges him - he must find 16 gold coins hidden on the island. Before taking a coin it's necessary to add two random numbers. For every coin he also receives two graphics with Lego minifigures. After collecting all the coins the player can change them in the castle for new buildings which will appear on the island, but... Nobody is in the castle, only a skeleton in the dungeon... Something strange happens: instead of getting new buildings, player is sent to the dark forest full of creatures... There is a solar eclipse and physics is disturbed... The hero needs to restore the order on the allotment.

## Development

The game was originally created for (like a few other projects) my nephews - because of that, you can see buildings with banners: Mike and Janek.
